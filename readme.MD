## Limio

Welcome to the Limio coding interview.

## Our tech stack

The Limio tech stack is always evolving as we continue to seek out the best tools for the job. Our main tech stack is:

  * React with Redux (front-end of our main app & Limio Shop)
  * Gatsby (Limio Shop)
  * AWS Lambda with Serverless for our backend API
  * Node.js for the above & our product catalog backend
  * AWS DynamoDB for our main database
  * Git for our product catalog storage
  * AWS Cognito for our user management
  * We build with Webpack
  * Jest for testing
  * Other AWS services for serving builds/files such as S3, Cloudfront, amongst others

And we are currently working towards introducing the following:

 * React testing library to replace some of component tests
 * Refactoring to use React hooks across our codebase where possible
 
We will continue to discuss & add new tech where we feel it would improve our products.

### Instructions

Please answer the question below (just write the answers in the spaces provided). Once the coding examples are done, please zip up your files and send them via http://wetransfer.com (GMail blocks ZIP attachments).  

We can then discuss the changes that you have made.

### Overview

The directories contain 3 sample apps. They are based on the the tic-tac-toe react tutorial, which you can find at [https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html].

The directories are:

| Directory      | Contents    |
| ---------------|-------------| 
| app-original   | The original app from the tutorial |
| app-standalone | The same app, but re-written slightly (this has been updated to move away from class components and use functional components with React hooks) |
| app-redux      | The same app, using redux |

### Questions

Please answer the following questions:
    
1. Comparing the app-original and app-standalone code bases. The app-standalone code base has put each component in a separate file and directory structure.   
   * Why do you think that was done, what are the advantages / disadvantages?

**Spliting into separate folders allows for better readability of the app structure, as well as a degree of isolation of the components. It makes it easier to work on different components and to identify faults, bugs. It is especially useful if the app continues to grow in complexity. A huge monolithic format may become difficult to read and understand. A disadvantage may be the initial time commitment to set the folders up and in case of smaller apps may make things more complicated than they should be. 

2. Thinking about a production ready app, what do you think is missing from all the examples? *Hint: the square component in the standalone app has one*

**Tests are missing and the square on the stadnalone app has one. Tests are essential to make sure the app will function as intended prior to going live, helping to avoid costly rollbacks and downtime. 

3. Are you familiar with Redux? If so what is the basic idea behind it and what would be a good case for using it?

**I am not familiar with Redux, but after some research online here is my understanding of what Redux is about. Due an to an ever-increasing complexity of modern apps, managing state became a huge challange. This is due to many processe potentially affecting others and in turn affecting more processes. In an nutshell most modern apps go through mutations in asyncronous fashion, meaning that we do not know what EXACTLY is happening in our apps at any given moment in time. Redux is aiming to solve this for the data layer of the app. React helps to address this issue via a view layer, however it doesn't help with the data layer. A good case for using is any complex, dynamic app with lots of actions happening simultaneusly such as social networks and booking systems.

4. *If you are interested in the full-stack role* Please take a look at the partial implementation of an express routes in backend/router.js.
    * Thinking of a production application, what issues do you see with this code? *List as many as you like* 

### Coding Challenges

With either the app-standalone or app-redux (**not both** - whichever you are comfortable with), please complete the following changes:

1. Update the app so that is highlights the winning move.

**I am afraid I can't quite do this exercise properly, because I am not familiar with JavaScript at this stage. I reckon I would do it in the Square section of the app, where I woudl implement a logic to highlight the square if the move was the winning move. Something like if the move is winning, highlight state is on, else highlight state is off. 

2. Update the app so that it allows for a named player X and Y, and it keeps a league table of who won each game.

**I am afraid that's beyond my capabilities at this stage. 

3. If you get time, implement something that you think that the app could do and is cool. What other things would you change.

### Expectations
 * We don't want you to spend too long on this exercise, just the necessary amount of time to show your front-end and back-end skills. We expect it to take 1.5 hours if you have React experience, longer if you have no React experience. 
    * If you don't answer all questions, that is fine. We prefer depth on a few questions rather than superficial answers.
 * Some testing, but not extensive. Have at least one test case, so that we know you can do it. 
    * You'll notice the example code doesn't have much testing. It should.
 * Clean, concise code. Comments are appreciated.
 * Knowledge of up to date React features e.g. Hooks.
